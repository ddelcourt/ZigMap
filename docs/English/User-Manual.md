## Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Tab | Hide / show control panel |
| Enter | Fullscreen |
| P | Export PNG (includes overlay) |
| S | Export SVG (vector only) |
| D | Export depth map |
| R | Reset camera |
| 0 | Reset zoom |

## Main controls (left panel)

### Project

- **Save**: downloads the complete project (states and camera positions) to a JSON file.
- **Load**: opens a previously saved project.

At first launch, a starter project with example states loads automatically.

---

### States

States are complete snapshots of parameters. They allow memorizing and recalling different configurations.

- **State list**: displays all saved states.
- Clicking a state in the list loads it with an animated transition.
- **Save**: saves the current configuration as a new state.
- **Update**: overwrites the selected state with the current configuration.
- **Delete**: removes the selected state.
- **Rename**: click on a state name to edit it.

**Transition controls**
- **State Transition** (0–30 s): duration of transition between states.
- **Color Transition** (0–30 s): duration of color palette transitions.

**Auto-Trigger**
Check Auto-Trigger to automatically alternate between states. The Frequency slider (5–120 s) defines the interval. A shuffle algorithm ensures each state is visited once before repetition.

---

### Color palettes

Four distinct palettes, each with four color slots.

- Select a palette via buttons 1–4 at the top of the section or corresponding keys.
- Click a color picker to modify a hue.
- Assign a role to each color: **Line** (zigzag lines), **Background** (canvas background), or **None** (disabled).
- **Color Depth Separation**: Z-axis spacing between lines of different colors.

When changing palettes, existing lines transition smoothly to new colors.

---

### Rendering

Output resolution controls, applied to exports.

- **Framebuffer Resolution**: check to lock the canvas to a fixed resolution.
- **Preset**: quick selection among common resolutions (HD, 4K, Instagram formats).
- **Resolution**: manual entry of width and height in pixels.

---

### View

Camera and display settings.

- **Field of View**: camera field of view angle in degrees.
- **Clipping Planes**: near and far visibility range.
- **Stereoscopic View (VR)**: check for side-by-side VR mode.
- **Eye Separation**: distance between stereo cameras, active only in stereoscopic mode.

---

### Geometry

- **Segment Length**: height of each zigzag segment.
- **Line Thickness**: width of zigzag ribbons.
- **Emitter Rotation**: rotates the entire emission pattern.
- **Geometry Scale**: global scaling of geometry.
- **Fade Duration**: duration of line fade in/out.

---

### Animation

- **Emit Rate**: frequency of line creation (lines per second).
- **Speed**: movement speed of lines in space.
- **Ambient Speed Master**: global speed multiplier.

---

### Modulations

- **Random Thickness**: check to apply random variation to line thickness.
- **Thickness Range**: min/max variation for random thickness.
- **Random Speed**: check to apply random variation to line speed.
- **Speed Range**: min/max variation for random speed.

---

### Overlay

Static images overlaid on top of the animation for branding, watermarks, or design elements.

**Preset overlays**
- **Preset dropdown**: select from pre-configured overlays in `assets/overlays/` folder.
- Instant loading of Base64-encoded images.

**Custom images**
- **Load Custom Image button**: import PNG, JPG, or SVG files.
- Recommendation: use PNG with transparency for logos.
- Overrides preset selection.

**Appearance controls**
- **Show Overlay**: checkbox to toggle visibility.
- **Scale** (10–200%): resize the overlay image.
- **Opacity** (0–100%): transparency level.
- **Position X/Y** (0–100%): place the image anywhere on screen.
- **Clear Image button**: remove current overlay.

**Export behavior**
Overlays are included in PNG, video, and depth map exports. Overlays are excluded from SVG exports (vector only).

**Creating new presets**
Use the utility tool at `utilities/overlay-converter.html` to convert images to Base64 JSON format. Place JSON files in `assets/overlays/` folder and reload the application.

## Export

### PNG export
Press p or click Export PNG. Captures current frame as PNG image. Resolution matches current canvas size. Includes overlay if active. Automatic adjustment for high-resolution displays.

### SVG export
Press s or click Export SVG. Exports current frame as vectorsvg file. Resolution-independent format. Ideal for print or vector editing. Does not include overlay (vector only).

### Depth map export
Press d or click Export Depth Map. Exports depth information as grayscale PNG. White = close to camera, black = far away. Use cases: post-processing, compositing.

### Video recording
1. Set Duration (how many seconds).
2. Set Frame Rate (30 FPS is standard).
3. Click Record Video button.
4. Wait without interacting with the page.
5. Video downloads automatically when complete.

Includes overlay on every frame if active.

## Troubleshooting

**Nothing appears**
Check emit rate > 0. Adjust camera distance with scroll wheel.

**Too busy or cluttered**
Lower emit rate slider.

**Lines disappear**
Lines move out of view. This is normal.

**Cannot rotate camera**
Cursor must be on animation area, not control panel.

**Video does not download**
Wait longer. Large videos take time to process.

**Fullscreen does not exit**
Press Escape key.

**Overlay not showing**
Check Show Overlay is enabled. Verify opacity > 0%.

**State loads to wrong position**
Camera position is saved with each state. Click state again if needed.

**Cannot rename state**
Click directly on state name text.

**Keyboard shortcuts do not work**
Ensure state rename mode is not active. Shortcuts disabled while editing state names.

---

## Resolution and output sizes

**For fixed output size:**
1. Check Framebuffer Resolution.
2. Choose a Preset: 1920×1080 (HD), 1080×1080 (square), 3840×2160 (4K), 1080×1440 (portrait).
3. Export normally.

**For window size:**
Leave Framebuffer Resolution unchecked. Exports use browser window size.

**Settings automatically save in browser localStorage. Reload the page to find everything as it was left.**
