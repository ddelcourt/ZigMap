## Core concepts

### States

States are complete snapshots of configuration (parameters, colors, camera position).

**Basic usage:**
1. Open States panel
2. Click any state to load it with smooth transition
3. Click Save to create a new state
4. Click Update to overwrite the selected state
5. Click Delete to remove a state
6. Click on a state name to rename it

**Auto-trigger:**
Enable Auto-Trigger to automatically cycle through states. Frequency slider (5–120 seconds) defines the interval. A shuffle algorithm ensures each state is visited once before repetition.

**Transitions:**
- State Transition (0–30 s): duration for parameter changes
- Color Transition (0–30 s): duration for color palette changes

### Colors

Four distinct palettes, each with four color slots. Press 1, 2, 3, or 4 to switch palettes instantly.

**Color configuration:**
- Click color picker to set RGB values
- Set role for each slot: Line / Background / None
- Multiple slots can have the same role
- Lines randomly select from available Line colors at generation

When switching palettes, all existing lines and the background transition smoothly via RGB interpolation.

**Color depth separation:**
Controls Z-axis spacing between lines of different colors to reduce overlap (z-fighting). Formula: each slot offset = `(slotIndex - 2) × multiplier`.

### Overlays

Static images overlaid on the animation. Included in PNG and video exports. Excluded from SVG exports.

**Preset overlays:**
1. Open Overlay section
2. Select from Preset dropdown (loads from `assets/overlays/`)
3. Enable Show Overlay checkbox

**Custom images:**
1. Click Load Custom Image
2. Select PNG, JPG, or SVG file
3. Adjust Scale, Opacity, Position sliders

Supported formats: PNG (recommended for transparency), JPG, SVG.

## Complete UI reference

### UI section

**Hide controls** (Tab): hides the control panel. Press again to show.

**Fullscreen** (Enter): activates browser fullscreen mode. Press Escape to exit.

---

### Project section

**Save** (Ctrl+S / ⌘+S): downloads current parameters to a timestamped `.json` file. All parameters and camera position are included.

**Load**: opens file picker to load a previously saved `.json` configuration. All parameters are applied immediately and persisted to localStorage.

Parameters are automatically saved to localStorage on every change.

---

### States section

- **State list**: displays all saved states
- **Save**: saves current configuration as a new state
- **Update**: overwrites selected state with current configuration
- **Delete**: removes selected state
- **Rename**: click on state name to edit

**State Transition** (0–30 s): duration of transition between states.

**Color Transition** (0–30 s): duration of color palette transitions.

**Auto-Trigger**: automatically alternates between states. Frequency slider (5–120 s) defines interval. Shuffle algorithm ensures each state is visited once before repetition.

---

### Camera section

**Stereoscopic view (VR)** — default: off  
Divides view into left and right eye perspectives, side by side. Green borders indicate active mode. Each eye occupies half the window width.

**Eye separation** — range: 0–100, default: 30, units: world space  
Distance between left and right camera positions. Higher values accentuate 3D effect. Active only in stereoscopic mode.

**Framebuffer resolution** — default: off  
Locks canvas to specific pixel resolution instead of window size. Gray border indicates active mode. Canvas scales down to fit window if necessary.

**Preset** — type: dropdown, default: 1920×1080  
Quick selection of common resolutions:

| Preset | Resolution |
|------------|------------|
| HD Horizontal | 1920×1080 |
| HD Vertical | 1080×1920 |
| HD Small Square | 1080×1080 |
| HD Large Square | 1920×1920 |
| 4K Horizontal | 3840×2160 |
| 4K Vertical | 2160×3840 |
| 4K Small Square | 2160×2160 |
| 4K Large Square | 3840×3840 |
| Web banner | 3500×1500 |
| Instagram post | 1080×1440 |
| Custom | — |

Active only in framebuffer mode.

**Resolution (Width × Height)** — default: 1920×1080, minimum: 320×240  
Manual entry of pixel dimensions. Changing these values sets preset to "Custom".

**Field of view** — range: 0.01–180°, default: 60°  
Low values (30–40°) produce architectural rendering. High values (90–120°) accentuate perspective.

**Clipping planes** — near: 0.01–500, far: 500–20,000, default: 0.01 / 20,000  
Defines visible portion of 3D space. Adjust if geometry appears clipped at extreme zoom levels.

---

### Geometry section

**Geometry height** — range: 10–240, default: 120, units: pixels

**Line thickness** — range: 1–60, default: 8, units: pixels  
Width of zigzag ribbon. Thick lines may overlap; thin lines produce more delicate patterns.

**Geometry scale** — range: 100–400%, default: 100%  
Global scaling of space. Does not affect canvas size.

---

### Behavior section

**Emit rate** — range: 0.1–10, default: 1.5, units: lines per second  
Frequency of new line creation. High values densify the screen; low values space out the animation.

**Speed** — range: 10–500, default: 80, units: pixels per second  
Movement speed of lines in space.

---

### Modulations section

**Random thickness** (t) — default: off  
Applies random variation to each line's thickness.

**Thickness range** — range: 10%–400%, default: 10%–200%  
Minimum and maximum variation when random thickness is enabled.

**Random speed** (m) — default: off  
Applies random variation to each line's speed.

**Speed range** — range: 10%–400%, default: 30%–200%  
Minimum and maximum variation when random speed is enabled.

---

### Colors section

**Color palettes**  
Four distinct palettes, each with four color slots. Keys 1, 2, 3, 4 toggle between palettes.

**Color customization**  
Each slot has a color picker (RGB) and a role:
- **Line**: color of zigzag ribbons (random selection at generation)
- **Background**: canvas background color
- **None**: slot disabled

Multiple slots can have the same role.

**Color depth separation** — range: 10–500, default: 100  
Controls Z-axis spacing between lines of different colors. Higher values reduce visual overlap (z-fighting). Formula: each slot offset = `(slotIndex - 2) × multiplier`.

**Color transitions**  
When changing palettes, all existing lines and background transition smoothly over configured duration via RGB linear interpolation.

---

### Overlay section

**Show overlay**  
Checkbox to toggle overlay image visibility. Image remains loaded when hidden.

**Preset dropdown**  
Pre-configured overlays from `assets/overlays/` folder. Instant loading of Base64-encoded images. Select "-- Custom Image --" to load your own file.

**Load custom image**  
Opens file picker to import image. Supported formats: PNG, JPG, SVG. Image encoded as Base64 temporarily. Automatically enables Show Overlay checkbox. Overrides preset selection.

**Scale** — range: 10%–200%, default: 100%  
Resizes overlay image.

**Opacity** — range: 0%–100%, default: 100%  
Controls overlay transparency.

**Position X / Y** — range: 0%–100%, default: 50% / 50%  
Places overlay anywhere on screen. 0%, 0% = top-left; 100%, 100% = bottom-right; 50%, 50% = centered.

**Export behavior**  
Overlays are included in PNG, video, and depth map exports. Excluded from SVG exports (vector only). To export without overlay: uncheck Show Overlay before exporting.

---

### Export section

**Export PNG** (P) — format: `.png`  
Direct canvas capture with transparency. Dimensions match current canvas (or framebuffer dimensions if enabled).

**Export SVG** (S) — format: `.svg`  
Vector version of current image, line by line with exact projection. Infinite scaling without quality loss.

**Export depth map** (D) — format: `.png` grayscale  
Encodes Z depth as brightness: close = white, far = black.

**Video recording** — format: `.webm` or `.mp4`  
Frame-by-frame capture for smooth, deterministic rendering. Start/stop from Export section UI. Red indicator displays during recording. File automatically exports when stopped.

## Best practices

### Performance

- Reduce emit rate to improve performance on slower systems
- High-resolution framebuffer mode (4K) demands more GPU
- Stereoscopic mode performs two simultaneous renders; reduce resolution if slowdown occurs
- Hide UI panel (Tab) for maximum performance

### Composition

- Position key elements off-center
- Use camera rotation to reveal spatial layers
- Bright colors on dark backgrounds produce high contrast
- Adjust Color Depth Separation to prevent z-fighting

### VR viewing

- Start with separation of 30 and adjust according to screen distance
- Avoid excessive separation to limit eye strain

### Recording

- Set all parameters before starting recording
- Close other applications to free up resources
- Short recordings (10–30 seconds) are easier to manage

### Social media export

- Instagram: 1080×1440 preset
- Web banner: 3500×1500 preset
- Twitter/X: 1920×1080 for video posts

### Development

Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 modules) with p5.js for WebGL rendering.

**Main dependencies:**
- p5.js v1.9.0 (WebGL mode)
- CCapture.js v1.1.0 (video capture)

**Architecture:**
- Modular ES6 classes in separate files
- State management via localStorage
- Event-driven UI updates
- CPU-based projection for SVG and depth map exports

### Troubleshooting

**Lines not appearing**  
Check that emit rate > 0. Adjust camera distance with scroll wheel.

**Clipping issues**  
Adjust near/far clipping planes in Camera section at extreme zoom levels.

**Panning not working**  
Camera distance must be ≥ 50. Zoom out if necessary.

**Settings not saving**  
Verify browser localStorage permissions are enabled.

**Video file too large**  
Reduce duration, frame rate, or resolution in Export section.

**Choppy animation**  
Lower emit rate or close other programs. Disable random thickness/speed if lag persists.

**Overlay not showing**  
Check Show Overlay checkbox. Verify opacity > 0%. Ensure image loaded successfully.

**State renaming fails**  
Click directly on state name text. Avoid triggering keyboard shortcuts during rename.

**Keyboard shortcuts not working**  
Ensure state rename mode is not active. Shortcuts disabled while editing state names.
